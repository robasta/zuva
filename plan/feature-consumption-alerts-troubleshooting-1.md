# Consumption Alert Monitoring Service Troubleshooting

![Status: In progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20progress-yellow)

The user reports that their system has been over 700W consumption for the past hour but is not receiving low priority alerts as configured. This plan addresses the issues preventing consumption alerts from functioning properly.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Consumption alerts must trigger when 700W (0.7kW) sustained consumption exceeds low threshold for 20+ minutes
- **REQ-002**: Alert monitoring must run during configured time window (18:00-03:00)
- **REQ-003**: Backend consumption monitoring service must be operational and processing real-time data
- **REQ-004**: Alert configuration must be properly loaded and applied
- **SEC-001**: Authentication and authorization must work for alert endpoints
- **CON-001**: Must fix InfluxDB query issues preventing data retrieval
- **CON-002**: IntelligentAlertMonitor configuration management must be functional
- **GUD-001**: Real-time consumption data must be available via API
- **PAT-001**: Alert notification system must be properly integrated

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Implementation Phase 1: Diagnose Current Issues

- GOAL-001: Identify and resolve backend service issues preventing consumption alerts

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-001 | Fix InfluxDB query error: "'list' object has no attribute 'empty'" | | |
| TASK-002 | Resolve IntelligentAlertMonitor config_manager attribute error | | |
| TASK-003 | Verify consumption data is being collected and stored properly | | |
| TASK-004 | Check if consumption monitoring service is running during alert window | | |
| TASK-005 | Validate alert configuration is loaded and applied correctly | | |

### Implementation Phase 2: Fix Backend Monitoring Service

- GOAL-002: Implement functional consumption threshold monitoring

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-006 | Implement consumption data retrieval from InfluxDB | | |
| TASK-007 | Create consumption threshold detection logic | | |
| TASK-008 | Implement time-window based monitoring (18:00-03:00) | | |
| TASK-009 | Add sustained consumption period tracking (20+ minutes) | | |
| TASK-010 | Integrate with existing alert notification system | | |

### Implementation Phase 3: Test and Validate

- GOAL-003: Verify consumption alerts work correctly for 700W scenario

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-011 | Test consumption alert triggers at 700W threshold | | |
| TASK-012 | Verify alert notifications are sent through configured channels | | |
| TASK-013 | Test time-window restrictions work correctly | | |
| TASK-014 | Validate sustained period detection (20 minutes) | | |
| TASK-015 | Test different severity levels (low, high, critical) | | |

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Use simple polling instead of intelligent monitoring - Rejected for scalability
- **ALT-002**: Implement consumption alerts as separate microservice - Considered for future
- **ALT-003**: Use webhook-based alerts instead of internal monitoring - May implement later

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: InfluxDB database with consumption data
- **DEP-002**: Real-time data collection service (sunsynk-collector)
- **DEP-003**: Existing AlertManager and notification system
- **DEP-004**: Alert configuration management system
- **DEP-005**: Time zone utilities for window-based monitoring

## 5. Files

- **FILE-001**: `/backend/main.py` - Main FastAPI application with alert endpoints
- **FILE-002**: `/backend/alerts/intelligent_monitor.py` - Consumption monitoring logic
- **FILE-003**: `/backend/alerts/models.py` - Alert configuration and instance models
- **FILE-004**: `/frontend/src/pages/Settings/Settings.tsx` - Alert configuration interface
- **FILE-005**: `/collector/models.py` - Data collection and storage

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-001**: Verify InfluxDB queries return consumption data correctly
- **TEST-002**: Test consumption threshold detection with 700W input
- **TEST-003**: Validate time-window monitoring during 18:00-03:00 period
- **TEST-004**: Test sustained consumption period tracking
- **TEST-005**: Verify alert notifications are sent and received

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: InfluxDB data format may have changed requiring query updates
- **RISK-002**: Alert configuration may not be persisting correctly
- **RISK-003**: Time zone issues may affect monitoring window detection
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Consumption data is being collected every 30 seconds
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: User's system time and timezone are configured correctly
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Alert notification channels are properly configured
