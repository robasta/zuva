# Consumption Threshold Alerts Implementation

![Status: Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-brightgreen)

Implementation of consumption threshold alerts that monitor energy usage and trigger alerts when consumption exceeds configurable thresholds during specified time periods. This feature also includes cleanup of duplicate battery threshold components from the Settings UI.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Alert when consumption exceeds 1kW (critical), 0.8kW (high), 0.7kW (low) continuously for over 20 minutes
- **REQ-002**: Time-based monitoring between 18:00 and 03:00 (configurable)
- **REQ-003**: All consumption alert settings must be configurable in Settings > Alerts screen
- **REQ-004**: Remove duplicate battery threshold components from Settings UI
- **SEC-001**: Maintain existing alert system functionality while adding consumption monitoring
- **CON-001**: Must integrate with existing AlertConfiguration interface
- **GUD-001**: Use consistent UI patterns and Material-UI components
- **PAT-001**: Follow React/TypeScript best practices for component development

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Implementation Phase 1: Alert Configuration Interface Updates

- GOAL-001: Extend AlertConfiguration interface to support consumption thresholds

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-001 | Add consumption_thresholds to AlertConfiguration interface | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |
| TASK-002 | Include critical_threshold_kw, high_threshold_kw, low_threshold_kw fields | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |
| TASK-003 | Add sustained_consumption_minutes for duration tracking | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |
| TASK-004 | Include start_time and end_time for monitoring window | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |
| TASK-005 | Add enabled flag for consumption alert control | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |

### Implementation Phase 2: Settings UI Enhancement

- GOAL-002: Create consumption threshold configuration UI and remove duplicates

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-006 | Create Consumption Thresholds accordion in Settings > Alerts tab | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |
| TASK-007 | Add configurable threshold inputs for critical, high, and low levels | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |
| TASK-008 | Implement time picker inputs for start and end monitoring times | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |
| TASK-009 | Add sustained period configuration input | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |
| TASK-010 | Include enable/disable toggle for consumption alerts | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |
| TASK-011 | Add informational alert showing current configuration summary | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |

### Implementation Phase 3: UI Cleanup

- GOAL-003: Remove duplicate battery threshold components from Settings interface

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-012 | Remove duplicate "Battery Alert Thresholds" Card component | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |
| TASK-013 | Add missing Home icon import for consumption threshold section | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |
| TASK-014 | Verify Settings UI consistency and proper component organization | ✅ | 2024-12-21 |

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Implement consumption alerts as separate service - Rejected to maintain unified alert configuration
- **ALT-002**: Use fixed time windows instead of configurable periods - Rejected for flexibility requirements
- **ALT-003**: Create separate Settings tab for consumption alerts - Rejected to keep related alerts together

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: React/TypeScript frontend framework
- **DEP-002**: Material-UI (@mui/material) component library
- **DEP-003**: Existing AlertConfiguration system and interfaces
- **DEP-004**: Settings component infrastructure for configuration management

## 5. Files

- **FILE-001**: `/src/pages/Settings/Settings.tsx` - Updated AlertConfiguration interface and Settings UI
  - Added consumption_thresholds to AlertConfiguration interface
  - Created Consumption Thresholds accordion section
  - Removed duplicate Battery Alert Thresholds Card
  - Added Home icon import

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-001**: Verify consumption threshold configuration saves properly
- **TEST-002**: Test time picker inputs for start/end monitoring periods
- **TEST-003**: Validate threshold input validation and constraints
- **TEST-004**: Confirm removal of duplicate battery threshold UI components
- **TEST-005**: Test enable/disable toggle functionality for consumption alerts

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Backend consumption monitoring service may need implementation - Alert configuration ready for backend integration
- **RISK-002**: Time zone considerations for monitoring periods - Uses existing timezone utilities
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Consumption data is available in real-time for monitoring
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: Alert system can handle multiple threshold types simultaneously
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: 20-minute sustained period is appropriate default for consumption monitoring
